## üî• Changelog

- **08.07.2025:** Added support for training IC-LoRAs (In-Context LoRAs) for advanced video-to-video transformations. See the [training modes](https://github.com/LightricksResearch/LTX-Video-Trainer-Internal/blob/main/docs/training-modes.md#-in-context-lora-ic-lora-training) doc for more details.
Pretrained control models: [Depth](https://huggingface.co/Lightricks/LTX-Video-ICLoRA-depth-13b-0.9.7), [Pose](https://huggingface.co/Lightricks/LTX-Video-ICLoRA-pose-13b-0.9.7), [Canny](https://huggingface.co/Lightricks/LTX-Video-ICLoRA-canny-13b-0.9.7).
- **06.05.2025:** Added support for LTXV 13B.
  An example training configuration can be found [here](configs/ltxv_13b_lora_cakeify.yaml).

## üç∞ Example Models

### Standard LoRAs
- [Cakeify LoRA](https://huggingface.co/Lightricks/LTX-Video-Cakeify-LoRA): Transforms videos to make objects appear as if they're made of cake. ([Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Lightricks/Cakeify-Dataset))
- [Squish LoRA](https://huggingface.co/Lightricks/LTX-Video-Squish-LoRA): Creates a playful squishing effect. ([Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Lightricks/Squish-Dataset))

### IC-LoRA Control Adapters
- [Depth Map Control](https://huggingface.co/Lightricks/LTX-Video-ICLoRA-depth-13b-0.9.7): Generate videos from depth maps.
- [Human Pose Control](https://huggingface.co/Lightricks/LTX-Video-ICLoRA-pose-13b-0.9.7): Generate videos from pose skeletons.
- [Canny Edge Control](https://huggingface.co/Lightricks/LTX-Video-ICLoRA-canny-13b-0.9.7): Generate videos from Canny edge maps. ([Canny Control Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Lightricks/Canny-Control-Dataset))

These examples demonstrate how you can train specialized video effects and control adapters using this trainer. Use these datasets as references for preparing your own training data.
